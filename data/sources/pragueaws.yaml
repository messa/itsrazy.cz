        There will be two speakers with the following presentations:


        • Building event-driven applications by Iaroslav Ustinov (Enterprise Solutions Architect CEE at Amazon Web Services - https://www.linkedin.com/in/iar-ustinov/)

        Although event-driven architecture pattern exists for a long time, recently it gained massive popularity. More and more companies design their modern applications using this approach and there are reasons for that.

        We will go through the event-driven architecture main components, typical scenarios and look what services and tools AWS has for helping you building applications using this approach. In the end of the session we will build a simple event-driven
        application.


        • AWS Control Tower - easy management of multi-account environment in AWS by Lukáš Pour (CTO at Trustsoft - https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukaspour/)

        Opening an AWS account is as easy as it gets - you just need a credit card, mobile phone and a computer with internet access. In the moment you start use AWS for production workloads, you realize that one account is not enough. Opening new AWS
        accounts and configure them manually does not scale well.

        AWS Control Tower comes to help, providing easy way to centrally manage multi-account AWS environments. It creates standardized, secure Landing Zone, making sure that new accounts are compliant with pre-defined standards that are in-line with AWS
        Best Practices. Lukáš will speak about his experience with deploying AWS Control Tower for customers in Czechia and other CEE countries.

      meta_description: 'We would like to invite you for the first online AWS CZSK User Group Meetup organized together with Amazon and AWS User Group Slovakia.


        Due to the fact that we can not meet in person we decided to switch to "online mode" and start doing the Meetups virtually in Czech / Slovak language.


        We apologize to the English speaking colleagues, but due to the fact that next few Meetups will be online - we will switch to Czech/Slovak. There are many "online" materials / presentations / meetups / other sources about AWS in English.


        When the situation will be better and we can meet in one place - the presentations will be in English again.


        Thank you for understanding...

        • How to migrate a large distributed system to AWS without a mental breakdown by Michal Artazov (Full-stack Developer at signageOS - https://www.linkedin.com/in/artazov/)

        The story of how we decided to migrate our entire system to AWS. Over the course of two months we planned it step by step only to see our plans fall apart in the real world. We cried a lot, spent nights in the office, wasted a ton of money but
        eventually we emerged victorious. Find out how we''re now using EKS and auto-scaling groups of EC2 instances to save money. How we replaced some microservices with Lambda. What other tricks we use to spend less money.Find out what lessons we learned
        while migrating our entire system to AWS. Learn how to avoid wasting time and money. AWS is awesome if you know what you''re doing.


        • Serverless on AWS: Architectural Patterns and Best Practices by Vladimir Simek (Senior Solutions Architect at Amazon Web Services - https://www.linkedin.com/in/vsimek/)

        When speaking about serverless on AWS, most people think about AWS Lambda. But there''s more than than. AWS provides a set of fully managed services that you can use to build and run serverless applications. Serverless applications don’t require
        provisioning, maintaining, and administering servers for backend components such as compute, databases, storage, stream processing, message queuing, and more. You also no longer need to worry about ensuring application fault tolerance and availability.
        Instead, AWS handles all of these capabilities for you. This allows you to focus on product innovation while enjoying faster time-to-market.

        Vladimir will guide you through AWS serverless services, show operational and security best practices, discuss potential pitfalls and nuances. This session will help you recognize candidates for serverless architectures in your own organizations
        and understand areas of potential savings and increased agility.
