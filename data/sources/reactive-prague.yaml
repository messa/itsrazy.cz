        JAKUB KOPRIVA

        #metatalk 15min


        TALK

        Connection optional data into strongly typed components using TS


        TALK ABSTRACT

        Typescript is very useful when it comes to developer confidence and speed of development if done right. We started adopting Typescript in our codebase and encountered a problem where data from the Redux state might be potentially undefined. There
        were multiple ways how to resolve this. One option was to override the type and enforce it when returned from Redux. We have decided to solve the problem more generically. We will take a look at the advantages and drawbacks of a few solutions including
        our chosen one.


        BIO

        Jakub has a wide variety of skills. He transitioned from backend technologies to frontend and started a game studio in the meanwhile. He believes Typescript will be the number one language in upcoming years for web

        TALK

        Fast & Furious - Going headless with Nuxt.js!


        TALK ABSTRACT

        This will be fast & furious! I will show you the fastest possible way to connect your Nuxt.js (Vue.js) project to the headless CMS and deploy it in seconds. You should know a thing or two about Nuxt.js, headless CMS in general or JAMstack as there
        will be no time to describe the concepts in detail. In the end, you will be furious at how insanely good the JAMstack is!

        A sneak peek into the future headless eCommerce

        Join us as we look into our crystal ball and predict the future! Jamstack brought us decoupled (not dystopian ) architecture. This new wave of SaaS products and services is here to stay. The advantages are clear:

        - better UX

        - better DX

        - faster websites

        - more effective development

        - previews with real-time editing experience

        - no need to know everything

        - we can focus!

        It’s clear that the industry will see continued growth in Jamstack & headless. Join me to learn how to take advantage of these technologies to build an eCommerce solution with Nuxt, Vue Storefront, BigCommerce and Storyblok, the headless CMS.


        BIO

        Samuel is responsible for the developer relations at Storyblok. As the headless system’s head of devrel, he spends most of his time buried in the documentation and creating various experiments and demos. He always defines himself as Creative FrontEnd
        Knight & DesignOps enthusiast with a passion for JAMStack and the beautiful web.

        As a determined community believer, he co-created multiple meetups and is always happy to help any community in need.

        𝗧𝗔𝗟𝗞 𝗔𝗕𝗦𝗧𝗥𝗔𝗖𝗧

        Handling data fetching is one of the biggest (and most duplicated) topics in web development. Web developers often need to write a lot of imperative code to retrieve data to display in our applications, or even more code to handle state management.
        GraphQL (and the surrounding ecosystem) can help you solve this. you can improve the DX of web development and I’ll show you how (even without a GraphQL server)!
