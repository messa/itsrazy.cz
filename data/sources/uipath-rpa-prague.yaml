        New monthly global meetup coming up!


        Incorporating API automation into your overall strategy allows both RPA and Test Teams to improve execution efficiency and minimize the impact of changing interfaces, making automations faster and more resilient. UiPath Studio now supports API
        Automation through its integration with Postman, a software development tool for performing calls to APIs. Using this integration allows Studio users to reuse advanced non-UI automations and tests that developers have built in Postman.


        This virtual meetup will explore the new API automation capabilities and how to leverage them in your RPA workflows or automated tests.


        How to sign up? Join our newest UiPath global community events platform: https://communityevents.uipath.com/events/details/uipath-global-virtual-events-presents-leveraging-api-automation-in-uipath-studio/


        Stay safe,

        Second most wanted virtual meetup is here: UiPath Test suite: Mobile Automation!


        Register for the session here: https://bit.ly/UiPathTestSuite.


        As soon as the sun shines and we struggle to wake up, the first thing we all need is our smartphone - even before we brush our teeth. People are consumed with their smartphones 24/7 and very rarely use a desktop computer for online activities.
        Businesses are making the best use of this opportunity by adopting a Mobile First strategy to rapidly expand their business. As such, applications are designed and launched for mobile devices before they are scaled up for larger display devices.


        This approach also requires a different testing strategy. Different network speeds, various input types, call interruptions, responsive design, and many other factors need to be considered in assessing the quality of mobile apps through test automation.


        Christian Mayer (Director, Product Management) https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-mayer-2a26b112a/ will share how the UiPath Test Suite helps you to create resilient automated tests for your mobile apps and how to integrate your mobile testing
        strategy into your broader testing strategy.


        Please join the virtual meetup here: https://uipath.zoom.us/j/96825515813


        Let’s virtually meet (again)!
