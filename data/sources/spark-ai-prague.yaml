        below) of the meetup:


        ==============================

        17:30 - 18:00 - Welcome drinks


        18:00 - 18:30 - "How to prepare data for fast analytical queries using Spark" - David Vrba (Socialbakers, Data Scientist)


        18:30 - 18:50 - 1st break (snacks)


        18:50 - 19:20 - "Spark job optimizations 101" - Peter Vasko (Socialbakers, Data Architect)


        19:20 - 19:40 - 2nd break (snacks)


        19:40 - 20:10 - "Stream the World with Spark" - Jiri Koutny (DataSentics, Data Solutions Architect)


        20:10 - 22:00 - Networking (beers, drinks and food)

        ==============================


        The meetup is organized by Socialbakers and DataSentics and will be all in English.


        Talk abstracts:

        "How to prepare data for fast analytical queries using Spark" - David Vrba (Socialbakers, Data Scientist)

        Apache Spark is often used for ad hoc data analysis which is possible due to its interactive console and integration with interactive notebook environments such as Jupyter, Apache Zeppelin or other notebook based solutions. Even though Spark provides
        parallel data processing the queries might still become quite slow if the data is large and has some inconvenient data format. In this talk, we show one practical example of how to prepare the data in the distributed file system to make it accessible
        by Spark as fast as possible and thus make the work of a data analyst more comfortable by reducing the query execution time. We will discuss techniques such as data partitioning, bucketing, sorting and others.


        "Spark job optimizations 101" - Peter Vasko (Socialbakers, Data Architect)

        We would like to show some basic and beginner-friendly optimizations for Spark jobs in general. Topics should target specific problems and describe a solution we would typically use in this scenario. Addressing a rather broad range of issues everyone
        working with Spark might encounter along the way. From lack of parallelism and shuffle spill through ineffective usage of resources or "many small files" issue. This is aimed more towards the less experienced users without going necessarily deep
        into the internals of spark, but touching as many areas as possible, so everybody should be able to find something new.


        "Stream the World with Spark" - Jiri Koutny (DataSentics, Data Solutions Architect)

        Welcome to the real-time world! Batch is dead, delete all the pipelines that run all the night, everything must be real-time now! Is it that simple? What are the meaningful use-cases for Spark Streaming? In the past months, we have built a streaming-based
        DataLake for 2 big enterprises. Come and learn what the main lessons learned and traps were.'

        open-source project MLFlow. After the sessions, we will be having a BBQ on the terrace at Socialbakers HQ office!


        ==============================

        17:30 - 18:00 - Welcome

        18:00 - 18:45 - David Vrba (Socialbakers): UDFs in Spark SQL

        18:45 - 19:15 - Break

        19:15 - 20:00 - Michael Shtelma (Databricks): MLFlow in action

        20:00 - 22:00 - BBQ and community building

        ==============================


        The presentations will be delivered in English.


        More about the talks:


        David Vrba (Socialbakers): User Defined Functions in Spark SQL

        In Spark SQL user defined functions (UDFs) are a technique how to execute a custom Scala, Java or Python code as a column transformation on a Spark DataFrame. It is widely understood that this flexibility is compensated by performance penalties.
        In this talk we will go over the possibilities that Spark SQL offers in regard to UDFs with Scala and Python and see what benefits were introduced by integrating PySpark with Pandas and Apache Arrow. Also we will discuss how the demand for UDFs
        was mitigated by releasing Higher Order Functions in Spark 2.4. This talk will be more theoretically oriented but we will also give some tips how to use these techniques in real-life queries and show some performance benchmarks to see how they
        differ in execution time.


        Michael Shtelma (Databricks): MLflow in Action

        MLflow is an open source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. It allows experiment tracking, machine learning models packaging in a reusable, reproducible form, and managing and deploying them from a variety of machine
        learning libraries to a variety of model serving platforms. During this talk, you can learn, how to get started with MLflow, track the basic metrics of your models and model artifacts in MLflow, package your models as MLflow projects and how to
        deploy your models using MLflow in the cloud.'
