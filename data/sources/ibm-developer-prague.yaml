      meta_description: 'A central focus of Quarkus is developer joy and productivity. As part of this focus, Quarkus provides a powerful development mode which, among

        other things, allows true hot compilation of code.


        In this talk we will take a look at this feature in detail. Aside from allowing hot reloading locally, we can also configure our application to allow hot reloading remotely. For example, the application could be running in a docker container or
        on a kubernetes-/openshift-cluster. This improves Dev/Prod-parity and thus enhances the development lifecycle.'

      meta_description: 'IBM & TCS Present: Communicating between Applications

        Intro to Enterprise Messaging & Event Streaming

        Enterprise messaging technologies, such as IBM MQ, have provided asynchronous communication within and across applications for many years. Recently, event streaming technologies (such as Event Streams built on Apache Kafka ) have grown in popularity,
        and they also provide asynchronous communication. Come join this exclusive webinar designed by IBM Developer and TCS to scrape the surface and truly understand why these technologies were created, and what use cases each technology is suitable
        for. By the end of this webinar, we will dive into a workshop where developers will get a better understanding of enterprise messaging at a hands-on level.


        In this webinar attendees will learn about:

        1. Key concepts of Enterprise Messaging vs. Event Streaming

        2. Tools and techniques to get started with messaging using IBM MQ

        3. Real-world use cases and scenarios for both messaging and event streams
