      meta_description: 'Hey designers! Let''s catch the last bits of summer sunlight and meet somewhere outdoors this time :)


        UX dinner is a meeting of the UX community in Brno. You can expect an informal dinner, discussing small design problems, an opportunity to find a mentor or a new project. We often discuss how to educate ourselves, what we as a community miss in
        Brno and what we can do about it. And do not hesitate to come even if you do not have "UX" on your business card!


        We will have a picnic this time so don''t forget to bring your blanket, food and some drinks! (In case you forgot, don''t worry, there''s a couple of places around the park with some food, too.)

      meta_description: 'World Interaction Design Day is an annual event where we come together as a united global community to show how interaction design improves the human condition.


        This year we‚Äôll look into topics: TRANSFORMATION AND SOLIDARITY - which are in the context of the global IXDD closely linked to the pandemic situation.

        We‚Äôll focus mainly on the concept of: Design in the Background - the areas most affected by covid events - such as education, healthcare, and travel. These have undergone the greatest transformations, but people still know little about all the
        changes, that happened, challenges overcome, the initiatives and projects created and what they are trying to achieve.


        *Admission fee is VOLUNTARY

        (There will be QR codes and cash points in the area and the proceeds will go to our partner NGOs)


        IMPORTANT UPDATE:

        This time we‚Äôll meet in-person for an offline event ü§©


        ‚û°Ô∏è Necessary covid measures:

        we''ll check your confirmation of: vaccination against covid 19/ PCR test not older 7 days/ antigen test not older 48 hours/ evidence of having contracted covid in the last 180 day + we''d like to ask you to wear a mask inside.

        ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

        Agenda:

        17:00. Doors open

        18:00 Official IXDD introduction + short intro from our venue host

        1. ƒåesko Digital - Project Uƒç√≠me online fights for educational transformations

        by Ane≈æka Muller, Project & Support Coordinator, ƒåesko.Digital


        Uƒç√≠me online was to help schools, teachers, parents and students to make the most of the remote education possibilities through technology. The current goal is to be a long-term driving force in the transformation of Czech education.


        Ane≈æka will walk you through the history and future of this project and what they have accomplished during their journey.

        2. Loono - All about prevention and VƒåAS app design story

        by Blanka Majnu≈°ov√°, Managing Director, and Otakar Hyp≈°, Product Designer


        Loono is the non-profit organisation, which focuses on educating the general public in the field of health and prevention and Blanka leads it on its mission. She has wide experience in the public health sector and has been with Loono for almost
        three years.


        Otakar is a freelance designer helping organisations define new products, improve services and provide better user experience. He leads a team of designers working on their app.


        Blanka and Oto will share with you Loono goals, its‚Äô journey and accomplishments for past years, especially will talk about their new community mobile app VƒåAS, that is going to disrupt the area where health insurance companies are failing. Long-term,
        the app should become a hub for evidence-based knowledge of health related topics as well as a personalised motivator guiding the users toward improvements in their daily habits.


        üí• As a bonus, thanks to Loono we‚Äôll be able to chat with their dedicated educators about prevention and broaden our horizons even more.

        3. Jana H≈ôebeck√° is a service designer who wants to create sustainable solutions with a positive impact on people as well as the planet


        A child''s loss is an unimaginable event for every parent. Unfortunately, life brings these hard moments and it is extremely important who stands by the family when they hear the news, cope with the situation, and heal themselves. Jana will tell
        you a story about the designer''s role in social innovation in the theme of perinatal loss (child''s death during the pregnancy or after the labor). This project was run by Unipa and funded by EU.
