      meta_description: 'One of the top use-cases for AI is Fraud Detection and Prevention. The power of avoiding and detecting Fraud in advance is clear: a few hours can have a major impact on losses. But fraudsters are becoming more and more sophisticated
        in their approaches and Fraud Detection is getting harder.


        Good news: AI can help!


        H2O.ai’s technology platform has helped to prevent Fraud for some of the biggest companies by as much as 80%.


        Want to know more? Join us on September 14th at 11:00am CET to understand how companies are using Machine Learning to increase the speed and accuracy of fraudulent activities identification, lower business risk and reduce costs.

      meta_description: '*Please note this session is part of the Snowflake Build Summit.


        Machine learning can help product teams deliver differentiated experiences to their customers. This session will demonstrate how to integrate Machine Learning into your applications. We''ll walk through a well-known data science dataset to predict
        loan risk, make loan repricing recommendations, and forecast the revenue impact of repricing. You''ll also learn how an H2O Driverless AI Machine Learning model can be deployed as a Java UDF and used with the Snowpark API and SQL—and bring model
        predictions into external-facing applications. With H2O models deployed in Snowflake, developers get increased performance and can interact with models using Snowflake native tools.

      meta_description: 'Hi Makers!


        If you''re interested in AI, Data Science, Machine Learning and more... then you''ve probably heard about Automated Machine Learning. But you might wonder - what is AutoML exactly, and how could it help you?


        Developing Machine Learning models is a very complex process. Regardless of industry and domain, developing a production-ready model that can bring business value may take months.

        At H2O.ai, we have made it our mission to help companies around the world and across industries on their journey with AI adoption. Automating Machine Learning will let you develop better models faster.


        Join us on October 20th at 11:00 am CET to learn about Automated Machine Learning and understand how H2O.ai can help you automate Machine Learning without compromising on model quality and performance.


        Make sure you register via the form on our website to get all the event details: https://bit.ly/30aEMYY


        See you there!
