        Join Tomás and Daniel from the Vaticle team where we discuss the origins of TypeDB, the impetus for inventing a new query language, TypeQL and why we are so excited about the future of software and intelligent systems.


        Each session will start with a community update and then our presentation. At the end, we open up the “floor” [read: zoom mic] and hear from you all, about:

        - Questions

        - Ideas

        - Feedback

        - Current projects

        - Anything that you’d like to share with the community

        Tomás is the Chief Operating Officer at Grakn Labs, dedicated to building a distributed Knowledge Graph for intelligent systems. He works directly with Grakn''s open source and enterprise users so they can fulfil their potential with Grakn and
        change the world. He focuses mainly in finance, life sciences and robotics.


        Daniel Crowe:

        Daniel is the Global Community and Partnerships manager for Grakn Labs, working to build a world class community of engineers, innovators, breakers of things. He works directly with the Grakn Community to accelerate projects, solve ever more complex
        problems and bring people together all over the world towards this common mission.'

        The Boston/FactEngine database productivity products are demonstrated over the TypeDB database engine.


        Topics include:

        - Natural language queries over a rule/inference-based schema and semantic modelling for TypeDB.

        - Knowledge graphs containing semantic information require the best tools to quickly find information and to visualise the schema in a graphical and textual form.

        - Boston and FactEngine exploit the basis of hypergraph technology to offer a solution to visualising and understanding schema and data within a TypeDB database implementation.

        - Beginners to TypeDB and TypeQL.

        - Those who have been using TypeDB and want a refresher on schema and TypeQL.

        - Experienced data analysts and software engineers.

        - Those who want to better represent their domain in a model that allows for logical reasoning at the database level.


        Description:

        In this TypeDB Academy, we will start by gaining an understanding of the fundamental components of the TypeDB software. We will see how we can download, install, run, perform all basic database operations, all the way to deploying the database
        for development, demonstration and production.

        Then we will explore what schema looks like within TypeDB, starting with clarifying the motivation for schema, the conceptual schema of TypeDB, and its relationship to the Enhanced Entity-Relationship model.


        Takeaways:

        - Understanding of fundamental components of TypeDB and how to download, install, run on your computer.

        - Be able to articulate why schema is so beneficial when using TypeDB, why we use one and how it enables a more expressive model.

        - Write a TypeDB schema in TypeQL.'

        Meet TypeDB Cluster, the TypeDB database for production-scale. Join us for a walk through the underlying architecture and what value it brings to developers running an application at scale.


        Speaker:

        Ganesh leads the development of TypeDB Cluster while also managing other aspects such as infrastructure and project management. His day-to-day work involves building concurrent and distributed algorithms such as Raft and the Actor Model.


        He graduated with an MSc of Grid Computing from University of Amsterdam, and has built several large scale distributed and real-time systems throughout his career.'
