        19:10 - 19:40 - Talk #1 Building Consistency in the World of Autonomous Teams by Ond≈ôej Havl√≠ƒçek, Head of UX & Graphics at Quadient


        19:40 - 20:00 - Talk #2: "How we solve inconsistencies in patterns to improve Quadient Design System" by Richard Grof, UX designer at Quadient

        ---


        Talk #1: "Building consistency in the world of autonomous teams" by Ond≈ôej Havl√≠ƒçek,

        This talk is about how Quadient is dealing with the challenges on their ‚Äûroad to a design system‚Äú. A story about the experience with implementing a design system in a large software company whose culture has always been about the great autonomy
        of the software development teams. It is about building a structure without a budget and without a dedicated team. Can there be some advantages to it?


        About Ond≈ôej:

        Ond≈ôej fell in love with UX design in 2008. Since 2012 I have been in charge of the UX & Graphics team at GMC Software Technology, later renamed to Quadient. Our software helps companies who need to communicate with their clients. He feels very
        strongly about the idea of consistency as part of great user experience. They started with a style guide, then a UI pattern library, and finally, they''re working on a design system now.


        ---


        Talk #2: "How we solve inconsistencies in patterns to improve Quadient Design System" by Richard Grof, UX designer at Quadient

        This talk will focus on two main areas:

        - Case study: Removing inconsistencies from UI patterns across the application.

        - Identifying opportunities for continuous improvements of the design system.


        About Richard:

        Richard work as a UX designer at Quadient. He has a passion for designing for user-friendly and accessible interfaces with meaningful interactions and reusability in mind.
