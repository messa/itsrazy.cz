      meta_description: 'This year HackPrague hackathon will ”Focus on the past to anticipate the future” 😎 There is no specific theme this year, but you can expect many interesting challenges from our sponsors and partners 💪


        Where: Prague

        -----------------------------------------------------------------

        What is a hackathon and why should I participate?


        We think of our hackathon as an "invention marathons" where participants have no restraints. Unlike other events, we don’t want you to come up with a startup MVP or a solution to a corporate problem. Unleash your creativity and technical skills!
        ❤️‍🔥


        There are several reasons why you should join a hackathon:

        ✅ free food and snacks for the whole weekend

        ✅ extend your skillset and learn a lot of new things while having fun

        REGISTRATION: https://form.typeform.com/to/pga3h56k


        Why are we organizing this?


        We feel that Prague and the Central European region have a tremendous creative potential that hasn’t yet been realized. Our mission is to become a platform for passionate technologists to meet, collaborate, and form relationships that extend well
        beyond the hackathon.


        There is always something extra 🔥

        ✅ For a weekend of innovation and fun with 150 coolest technologists

        ✅ Interaction with the top European and American companies

        ✅ Workshops and talks by experienced professionals

        ✅ Free food and swag

        ✅ Prize money


        What are the prizes?

        🥇 Grand prize: ~50 000 CZK

        🥈 2nd place prize: ~30 000 CZK

        🥉 3rd place prize: ~10 000 CZK

        … and many other sponsored prizes.


        Who can come?

        HackPrague applications are open to all developers and designers, including students and full-time employees. We will select participants based on their past projects, experience, and enthusiasm. We will aim to admit a diverse pool of people.

      meta_description: 'Last year we were building hacks to improve the life in cities with the motto “the future is already here, it’s up to us to distribute it equally”. This year we will focus on the financial sector.


        Nowadays, there are a lot of financial instruments and ready to use tools which are waiting to be connected into a meaningful application for customers.

        We also got more and more financial data available which can give us an interesting insight into the financial behaviour of people. Based on this insight we can, for example, educate people about their bad spending habits and help them make their
        spending more "healthy".

        In some parts of the world, the importance of blockchain is growing steadily as it helps people to save the value of their hyperinflated money. And again there are many tools waiting to be developed to work with crypto instead of money.

        What should be the new standard of banking and financial services?
