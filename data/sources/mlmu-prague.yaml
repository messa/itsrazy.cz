      meta_description: 'The artistic use of AI challenges some of the cornerstones of the modern Western concepts of art and creativity. The artist who works with AI blurs the lines that traditionally defined the roles played by makers and their tools.
        To what degree can we call AI-generated works as the product of genuine creativity? By inviting contemporary artists experimenting with AI and experts in the field, we will address these and other questions that are redefining the current understanding
        of what art is and the purpose of human ingenuity.

        with international venues, including Goethe Institute, Paris College of Art and Furtherfield. His articles on contemporary digital culture and art history are regularly featured in international art magazines, including Flash Art, Hyperallergic
        and Motherboard. His research focuses on digital culture and art in the broader context of art history. He worked on exhibitions, workshops and webinars aimed at developing a critical approach towards new media and online platforms that go beyond
        the “new media art” niche.


        Garrett Lynch is an artist, lecturer, curator and theorist. His work explores networks within an artistic context; the spaces between artist, artworks and audience as a means, site and context for artistic initiation, creation and discourse. He
        is currently Professor of Contemporary Art Practices / Experimental Media Arts at Srishti Institute of Art, Design & Technology, Bangalore in India.


        Paul Mouginot is an artist, engineer and founder of the artistic collective aurèce vettier, whose aim is to understand how relevant and meaningful interactions with machines and algorithms can be achieved, in order to push the boundaries of creative
        processes.


        Iskra Velitchkova is a Bulgarian artist currently based in Madrid. Her work explores the present and potential interactions between humans and machines and how instead of making technology more human, this relationship can push us to understand
        our limits better. After a proven record in the tech and artificial intelligence industry as a visual thinker, Iskra decided to apply her knowledge and experience at the service of her own research.'

      meta_description: 'We invite you to the lecture From Automation to Intelligence: The Long History of AI by Nathan Ensmenger from the Indiana University. This is the opening lecture of a discussion series called DDALOS co-organized by the AI Center
        FEE CTU and our friends at Machine learning Meetups (MLMU). Through six lectures planned for the 2021, we wish to bring together scientists, students and experts from various fields to tackle the questions of AI research and social responsibility.
        Specifically, the cycle will cover the following topics related to AI: creativity, journalism, fairness, sustainability, transhumanism and this opening lecture on the history of AI.


        Event description

        Although the history of artificial intelligence is full of claims that the field is just on the brink of a revolutionary transformation, the ideas and technologies at the center of the discipline have a surprisingly long history. By situating the
        history of the field within the larger context of the history of work, automation, computation, and philosophy, we can provide both insights into recent developments in artificial intelligence and a new perspective on some of the ethical, political,
        and economic issues posed by these developments.
