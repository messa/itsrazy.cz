      meta_description: 'If you want to succeed as a product-led company, you must ensure your teams are `empowered` enough to do the best work they can. As Marty Cagan famously wrote: "Great teams are comprised of ordinary people that are empowered and
        inspired. They are empowered to solve hard problems in ways their customers love, yet work for their business."


        In our next Pipedrive Talks Prague meetup, we''ll have a chance to listen to 3 great speakers from Mews, Productboard, and Pipedrive and get an insight look at how empowered product teams can work and what are the challenges connected with that.

        Agenda:


        18:00 â€“ Doors open, food and drinks ready


        18:30 â€“ The power of context by JiÅ™Ã­ Helmich, CPO at Mews (remote talk)


        Even if teams are empowered, they will fail if they don''t have the right context. Therefore, context is the most powerful tool of product leaders. Are you giving enough context? Are you getting enough context? Disclaimer: This talk might not have
        a tangible outcome.


        19:00 â€“ Asking your empowered team to make product commitments by Martin MatuÅ¡, Group PM at Productboard


        Much to the dismay of the contemporary Agile teams, the deadlines are here to stay. Let''s have a look at how empowered product teams should think about making commitments when they''re appropriate, and how to combine them with aspirational objectives
        and uncertain outputs.


        19:30 - break


        20:00 - World-class product teams don''t happen overnight

        by Jaana Metsamaa, Director of Product at Pipedrive


        Change will not happen overnight. You probably can''t implement everything that you read from Empowered or another great product book the next day. You will need to take the first step, then other small steps, and adjust as you go. This talk will
        be the story of our journey so far.


        20:30 â€“ More food and drinks and networking


        ---


        The meetup will happen in the Pipedrive office in KarlÃ­n, Prague and will be streamed online. The link to the stream will be provided on the day of the event.

        Speakers:


        ðŸ”ˆ Speaker 1: Nikolay Barbariyskiy, Architect at Applifting - Two Generals'' Problem


        "Let me tell you a story, to chill the bones", about two generals leading two armies who are preparing to attack a castle. For an attack to be successful, both armies need to attack at the same time. The armies are separated by the defenders of
        the castle, so any message sent, from one general to the other, can be potentially captured. Curious how our two generals have agreed on the time of attack? Or actually what the heck it has to do with Microservices? Well then just substitute generals
        with microservices, the castle defenders with the network, and join this awesome Pipedrive meetup :).
